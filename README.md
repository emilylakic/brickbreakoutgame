# CS441 SNAKE GAME ANDROID APP

## Functionality

The snake game app implements the SurfaceView class. It requires the user to control a 'snake', represented by a line of ombre white boxes, on a mission to capture a red dot on the screen. The user does not use their up/down/left/right keys but rather their mouse to click on different parts of the screen, controlled by the onTouchEvent() method in the SurfaceView SnakeEngine class. Both the target and snake were created using paint and canvas. To differentiate between the snake moving up/down/left/right, switch and case statements were used. My idea for this project came from my love of the snake game from when I was a child! I was always interested in making my own version one day. Though mine is very basic, and has a few things that can be improved, it was still fun to create. A few tutorials on the web helped me a great deal to start coding as I never made a game in Android Studio and it was quite different than past code completed using the software. On 09/23, I changed the orientation of the app to landscape for the user to better play the game. On 09/24, I learned about Android gaming by exploring past done tutorials and seeing how they function. On 09/25, I began coding my app from scratch after learning how gaming worked. On 09/26, I updated my required import statements and began to think of ways to implement a SurfaceView class. On 09/27, I decided to use SnakeEngine and created different methods that the software required for the class to subside errors. I then extended SurfaceView to allow for implementation. On 09/28 I spent the day working on the game and figuring out how to make it work. For now I must figure out why the red target goes out of the screen for a few frames as it is randomly positioned.
